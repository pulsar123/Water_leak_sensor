Water leak sensor based on ESP8266, which will sound a local alarm (piezo buzzer, LED) if a water leak is detected. It will also send the alarm over WiFi/MQTT to your smart home server (like OpenHAB), and will make all other water sensors in the house sound the alarm. The alarm can be temporarily silenced by pressing the button on any of the sensors. The number of flushes of the red LED during the alarm will tell you which of the sensors originated the alarm.
